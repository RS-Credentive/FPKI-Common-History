# Did this on a lark

This is a goofy little project that occurred as a side effect of a larger project: [Oscal-Pydantic](https://github.com/RS-Credentive/oscal-pydantic)

In this repository, you can find a versioned copy of the [Federal PKI Common Policy](https://github.com/RS-Credentive/FPKI-Common-History/blob/FCPCACPv2.6/tracked_policies/FCPCACP.md). 
There is branch for each version, so you can use github tools to compare different versions of the policy. In the [Tokenized Markdown]([https://github.com/RS-Credentive/FPKI-Common-History/tokenized_markdown/](https://github.com/RS-Credentive/FPKI-Common-History/tree/main/tokenized_markdown))
directory, you can find individual versions of policy in Markdown format, tokenized as described in a related project, [FPKI Policy Tokenizer](https://github.com/RS-Credentive/fpki-policy-tokenizer).

Enjoy!
